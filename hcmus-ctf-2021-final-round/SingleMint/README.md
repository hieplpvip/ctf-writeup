## SingleMint (200 points)

There is an affiliation activity from the hacker. Luckily, we have the memory dump of the victim's machine. Can you help us to reconstruct the attack scenario. How could they penetrate? Who were they? And what did they implant to the machine? Note: You have only 10 times to try to submit your flag!!! Be careful!!

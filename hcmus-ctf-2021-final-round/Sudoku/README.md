## Sudoku (200 points)

```
This is one of the most interesting forensics challenge which is created by my friend, and he also posted in the unknown wargame, the solution is not online, don't lose your time there, honestly and please do not upload the WU for this challenge too.

Anyway, there is the dump of the smartphone which is compromised by the hacker. The owner of this phone uses his phone for communications, playing games and storing documents, especially the company's plan. The hacker might place an APT on that phone. Please help us to find some evidences.

Note: You have only 10 times to try to submit your flag!!! Be careful!!

You should submit the flag in format: HCMUS-CTF{remote_domain:leaked_filename:malicious_application's_package_name}

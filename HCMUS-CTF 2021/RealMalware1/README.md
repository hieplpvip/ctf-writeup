A new ransomware is spreading wide, and xikhud is one of those victims. All of is data got encrypted. He sent a folder of encrypted data, and of course a sample of the malware to HCMUSML (HCMUS' Malware Laboratory) in the hope of getting back his data. Our researchers found that the malware sample was heavily obfuscated, but they had successfully decompiled, and translated it back to the C source code form. Unfortunately, they don't know how to decrypt the data. Can you help them ?
